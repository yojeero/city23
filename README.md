### [city23](https://city23on.vercel.app/) is a Progressive Web App (PWA) radio app.

city23 is a minimal, premium online radio player focused on chillout, lounge, pop, and disco sounds. city23 streams curated music 24/7 via a lightweight, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS player. The interface emphasizes simplicity: one hero image, a clear play/stop control, subtle animations, and responsive layout. The project is PWA‑ready, allowing users to install it as an app and enjoy quick access with native‑like behavior.
